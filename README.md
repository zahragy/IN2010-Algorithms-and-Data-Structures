Algorithms and Data Structures
Programming subject which combines practical programming in Java with a deeper theoretical understanding.

## Themes
1. Graph Theory
2. Sorting Algorithms
3. O-notation

## Learning Objectives
1. Learning Datastructures such as
  - Lists
  - Trees
  - Graphs
  - Hashtables
  - Priority searcher
 which you will use to make effective programs.

2. Mastering good solutions for problems that are related to searching and sorting, as well as mastering graphs.
 
3. Using recursive programming to solve some of the mentioned problems in an effective way.

4. Be able to detect and specify the effectiveness of a program, and you will be able to estimate the running time of a given program with datasets of different sizes. 

### Chapter 1
#### Design of Scalable Algorithms and Data Structures
Being able to achieve scalability for a computer system can mean the difference between technological solution that can succeed in the marketplace or scientific application and one that becomes effectively unusable as data volumes increase.
